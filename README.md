# Discussion of the proposed solution

You might find inconistencies in the styling of this code. I decided not to focus on this issue because in real world, I'd install a linter which would deal for this issues for me. Programmers shouldn't care about those issues.

You'll find different implementation of the solution to this problem:
- one procedural programming implementation which style is like the one first implemented
- one procedural programming implementation which style is different but more readable in my opinion
- one implementation using object oriented design with inheritence

Which implementation should be implemented in real world should depend on discussion with other memebers of the team and how code is designed in other parts of the code base.
