# Usage

To create a log file for testing: `yarn start`

To run tests: `yarn test`

To run the linter: `yarn lint`

Instruction for this exercise has been moved to https://github.com/gbersac/legal-place/blob/main/INSTRUCTION.md

I renamed the original file `output.json` to `output-model.json`.

# Discussion of the proposed solution

You'll find different implementation of the solution to this problem:
- one procedural programming implementation which style is like the one first implemented
- one procedural programming implementation which style is different but more readable in my opinion
- one implementation using object oriented design with inheritence

Which implementation should be implemented in real world should depend on discussion with other memebers of the team and how code is designed in other parts of the code base.
